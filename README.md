## Main goal â™»â™»â™» 

Our client, Sun Energy and Co., is a prominent energy company situated in India. With the rapid growth of the Indian economy, the company is eager to extend its operations to Europe. The primary goal of this project is to develop a comprehensive visualization that compiles essential information for our client. As their aim is to establish a presence in the European market, a detailed analysis of the market is imperative. This involves examining the methods of energy production, understanding prevailing energy trends, investigating various energy sources, and presenting this information through a dynamic dashboard. The ultimate objective is to provide our client with a clear and insightful understanding of the European market's energy landscape, enabling them to make informed and strategic decisions to meet market demands.

## Insights 
- The comparison between fossil and renewable spanish energy determines that in the last year of our study, almost 34% (33,7) of the total energy produced comes from renewable and 66% from fossil sources. That means there is a stabilized market and little gap to explore 

- We have observed that the most intriguing countries in terms of renewable energy are:
   Cyprus: 3.93% of renewable energy
   Poland: 6.18% of renewable energy
   Lithuania: 8.88% of renewable energy
   Estonia: 7.3% of renewable energy
   Greece: 12.11% of renewable energy
   The above countries represent the more atractive markets to explore

- In big terms, we can determine that the European market is composed of almost 23 million Kw that comes from fossil sources and 5 million Kw from renewable sources.
